# Pawpering Vet Clinic CRM
CVTC VB.Net Final Project - Develop your own program. 

This is a basic Veterinary Clinic CRM Software 
It allows you to manage customer and pet information as well as pet history. 

Images: 
All the images are currently set to run from the debug folder to an "Images" folder in the main project folder. 
If you select an image in a different folder, it will make a copy and rename it with a date-time stamp, and put it into the designated images folder.

Below are a few screenshots of the program.
